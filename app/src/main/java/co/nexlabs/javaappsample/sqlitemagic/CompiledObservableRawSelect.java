   * provided model operations. Unsubscribe when you no longer want updates to a query.
   * <p>
   * Since database triggers are inherently asynchronous, items emitted from the returned
   * observable use the {@link io.reactivex.Scheduler} supplied to
   * {@link com.siimkinks.sqlitemagic.SqliteMagic.DatabaseSetupBuilder#scheduleRxQueriesOn}. For
   * consistency, the immediate notification sent on subscribe also uses this scheduler. As such,
   * calling {@link io.reactivex.Observable#subscribeOn subscribeOn} on the returned observable has no
   * effect.

   * Note: To skip the immediate notification and only receive subsequent notifications when data
   * has changed call {@code skip(1)} on the returned observable.
   * <p>
   * One might want to explore the returned type methods for convenience query related
   * operators.
   * <p>
   * <b>Warning:</b> this method does not perform the query! Only by subscribing to the returned
   * {@link io.reactivex.Observable} will the operation occur.
